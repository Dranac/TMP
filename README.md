#CRYBOARD

Hello, this is a training project. It won't work without API_KEY which i won't provide for obvious reason. 
Use this project to take a look at the code. It was initially to refresh my skill about symfony, ansible, vagrant and the management of API. 
NO DB ? Using a filesystem to store those small data are efficient enough.

Cryboard is a board which display markets information about some cryptocurrencies.
It will aggregate data from exchanges and website like coinmarketcap and display it in one place.
It's a good place to look current price of your favorite currency and to cry as you see it's so damn low everywhere.

## Installation
You need 
* Git
* Vagrant 
* VirtualBox

##### Step 1 :
    `vagrant up`

##### Step 2 :
    `vagrant ssh`

##### Step 3 :
    `cd cryboard & php /bin/composer.phar install`

Issue about Vagrant and Virtualbox shared folder ?
    
    `sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/VBoxGuestAdditions/mount.vboxsf /sbin/mount.vboxsfÌ€`

Possible issue about RSYNC. Check the src path. Fix it for your case.
    
## PART DOWN THERE WON'T WORK WITHOUT API KEY  
   
I recommend you to install ansible in the vagrant box. Then you'll be able to run the following command. This will set up cron task which will help you to sync exchange data to the different coins. (Don't do it inside the vagrant. Won't work without API KEY)

    `ansible-playbook playbook/cron.yml`

_**that's all folks**_
